# Queue Simulator

Java implementation of a **G/G/n/k queue simulation system**.  
This project is part of a practical assignment focused on simulating simple queues and analyzing their performance under different configurations.  

## üìå Overview

This simulator models **general arrival and service distributions** (`G/G/n/k`) with customizable parameters.  
It allows you to experiment with **different queue settings** by defining the number of servers, queue capacity, and random arrival/service times within configurable ranges.

The simulation produces statistical results such as:  

- Queue configuration (`G/G/servers/capacity`)  
- Arrival and service time ranges  
- State distribution table (time spent in each state and corresponding probabilities)  
- Number of clients lost due to queue capacity limits  
- Total simulation time  

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Compile the project
```bash
javac Main.java
```

### 2. Run the simulation
```bash
java Main run modelo.yml
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File

The simulator uses a YAML file (`modelo.yml`) to define queue parameters:

- `servers`: Number of servers in the system  
- `capacity`: Maximum number of clients allowed in the queue (including those being served)  
- `minArrival` / `maxArrival`: Minimum and maximum inter-arrival times  
- `minService` / `maxService`: Minimum and maximum service times  

### Example `modelo.yml`
```yaml
!PARAMETERS

rndnumbersPerSeed: 100000
seeds:
- 41

arrivals: 
   Queue1: 2.0

queues: 
   Queue1: 
      servers: 2
      capacity: 5
      minArrival: 2.0
      maxArrival: 5.0
      minService: 3.0
      maxService: 5.0
```

## üìä Example Output

## üéØ Assignment Context

For validation purposes, besides the source code, you must also deliver the **simulation results** for the following queues:

- `G/G/1/5`, arrivals in [2, 5], service in [3, 5]  
- `G/G/2/5`, arrivals in [2, 5], service in [3, 5]  

Simulation requirements:
- Start with an **empty queue** and the **first customer arriving at time 2.0**  
- Run the simulation with **100,000 random numbers**  
- Report:  
  - Probability distribution of queue states  
  - Accumulated times per state  
  - Number of lost customers (if any)  
  - Total simulation time
